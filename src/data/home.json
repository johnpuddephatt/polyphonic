    "about": "Polyphonic applies my experience from the advertising industry, where I worked with the world's biggest brands including Airbnb and Nissan, to lead new, purpose-led projects that create a positive impact in the world.\n\nAs a versatile freelancer, I'm experienced in developing and executing business and communications strategies, and providing day-to-day support to a diverse range of ambitious brands and organisations.\n\nThrough Polyphonic, I've defined [Joseph Rowntree Foundation](\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/\")'s role in entertainment; crafted an inspiring new proposition for [MAP Charity](\"https://www.mapcharity.org/\")'s £1.2m fundraising campaign; and delivered effective new business leadership for [Thompson Brand Partners](\"https://www.https://www.thompsonbrandpartners.com/.org.uk/\").\n\nI firmly believe in collaboration and inclusivity to ensure everyone has agency in the creative process. My approach combines this with my deep knowledge of branding, communications and cultural trends.\n\nYou can find my list of services, bio and contact details below.\n\n\n\nAntony\nFounder, Polyphonic",

    "me": "Following my time as the student president and a non-executive director of the University of Leeds, I left the North to join top-ten global ad agency [TBWA](\"http://www.tbwa.com\") in London. I spent three years there: bringing Nissan’s sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League to life; working with Airbnb; and, latterly, winning new business from brands like Starbucks and BNP Paribas.\n\nI then joined [Sunshine](\"http://www.thesunshinecompany.com\"), a creative agency specialising in entertainment, where I continued in new business and secured new work from BBC, Grey Goose and Sennheiser. I also led a revamp of Sunshine’s marketing efforts, helping to establish its foothold in the entertainment industry.\n\nBeyond advertising, I have always made an effort to support causes I believe in: engaging [schoolkids in the movement towards gender equality](\"https://inews.co.uk/essentials/great-men-project-sends-men-schools-teach-boys-feminism/\"); commenting on major political events in the national media, including the Supreme Court verdict on Brexit and the Labour Party leadership election; and advising Greenwich Students’ Union Board of Trustees on commercial and marketing issues as a co-opted trustee.\n\nToday, I'm back where it all began: in the North (it was only a matter of time) helping organisations and brands make the world a better place. I also study MA Applied Psychology of Music at the University of Leeds where I specialise in the wellbeing benefits of shared musical experiences.",
